the orchard whispered the names of every season in one breath and the village bells rang in two directions. she stepped through a doorway that only opened to inward journeys so the horizon leaned closer, becoming a bridge. the bridge asked to be crossed in both directions at once and every step stitched a seam between old and new. the bridge asked to be crossed in both directions at once so the sky folded and revealed a second sky within. she shared tea with her former self and passed the cup to her next self and the path answered with a spiral of light. she stepped through a doorway that only opened to inward journeys and the path answered with a spiral of light.

the orchard whispered the names of every season in one breath and the village bells rang in two directions. she stepped through a doorway that only opened to inward journeys so the horizon leaned closer, becoming a bridge. the bridge asked to be crossed in both directions at once and every step stitched a seam between old and new. the bridge asked to be crossed in both directions at once so the sky folded and revealed a second sky within. she shared tea with her former self and passed the cup to her next self and the path answered with a spiral of light. she stepped through a doorway that only opened to inward journeys and the path answered with a spiral of light.
