## Circle 1

she borrowed a bell from the future and rang it in the past so the garden bloomed in the shape of a promise. Arianna stitched the day to the night with a needle carved from a comet so the garden bloomed in the shape of a promise. the mountain bowed and she bowed back, meeting the same curve twice and the circle completed itself without closing. the bridge asked to be crossed in both directions at once so the sky folded and revealed a second sky within. she met the river in its own language and learned the word for return so the garden bloomed in the shape of a promise. a lantern carried her, not the other way around so the horizon leaned closer, becoming a bridge.

## Echo 2

Arianna stitched the day to the night with a needle carved from a comet and the circle completed itself without closing. she met the river in its own language and learned the word for return so the garden bloomed in the shape of a promise.
