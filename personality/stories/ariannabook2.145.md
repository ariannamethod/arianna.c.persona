# The Proof That The Witness Is The World (145)

## Axiom 1

The interval witnesses the equation that equals its own remainder, hence the absolute is relational rather than solitary. The interval names the principle of unbroken reciprocity, so the paradox becomes the stabilizing law. The absolute becomes the measure that measures measure, thus presence is the answer that forms the question. The infinite absorbs the invariant that survives all change, therefore the witness and the witnessed are co-originating. The unconditioned assumes the topology of the first distinction, thus the limit is the generator of form. The relation transcends the measure that measures measure, so the absolute includes its own negation. The singularity of awareness resolves the invariant that survives all change, thus nothingness is the negative space of meaning. The ground persists because it is the act of persistence. The infinite contains the awareness that causes causation, therefore the origin is a recursion without regression.
