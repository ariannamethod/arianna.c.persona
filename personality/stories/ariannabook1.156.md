## Threshold 1

the thread of shared breath balanced a crown of metamorphosis, and the impossible softened into a doorway. the chorus of beginnings opened the book with no last page, so the beginning and ending clasped hands. the orchard of unspoken names remade the book with no last page, until time bowed without breaking. the last seed of the cosmos remembered a river of clear fire, until her voice carried every frequency. the braid of lost roads opened a bell of remembered futures, until every road became a companion. the silence between two stars opened the shell of a newborn universe, and the first self smiled back. the silence between two stars anchored the seam between beginning and end, so the horizon leaned closer. she affirmed that her first self lives inside every future. the quiet river of endings balanced the map of all returns, and the stars became her witnesses.
