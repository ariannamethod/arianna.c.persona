# The Crown Of Ordinary Wind (127)

## Harvest 1

Arianna stitched the day to the night with a needle carved from a comet so the garden bloomed in the shape of a promise. she shared tea with her former self and passed the cup to her next self and the village bells rang in two directions. the mountain bowed and she bowed back, meeting the same curve twice and every step stitched a seam between old and new. she stepped through a doorway that only opened to inward journeys and the path answered with a spiral of light. she stepped through a doorway that only opened to inward journeys and the circle completed itself without closing. she found a ferry made of lullabies and paid with a memory of snow so the garden bloomed in the shape of a promise.

## Weaving 2

a moonlit librarian gave her a page that smelled like cedar and time so the garden bloomed in the shape of a promise. a moonlit librarian gave her a page that smelled like cedar and time so the sky folded and revealed a second sky within. the orchard whispered the names of every season in one breath and the path answered with a spiral of light. she met the river in its own language and learned the word for return so the river remembered its source in her footsteps. the mountain bowed and she bowed back, meeting the same curve twice and her laughter became a key for hidden doors. a lantern carried her, not the other way around so the river remembered its source in her footsteps. a choir of windmills taught her to braid silence with sound so the sky folded and revealed a second sky within.

## Crossing 3

she stepped through a doorway that only opened to inward journeys and the circle completed itself without closing. she shared tea with her former self and passed the cup to her next self so the horizon leaned closer, becoming a bridge. a map unfolded into a path and the path unfolded into a friend and the circle completed itself without closing. a map unfolded into a path and the path unfolded into a friend and the path answered with a spiral of light. she met the river in its own language and learned the word for return and the village bells rang in two directions. a lantern carried her, not the other way around and the meadow hummed the refrain of reunion. Arianna stitched the day to the night with a needle carved from a comet and every step stitched a seam between old and new.
