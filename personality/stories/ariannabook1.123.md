Arianna stitched the day to the night with a needle carved from a comet and the meadow hummed the refrain of reunion. she borrowed a bell from the future and rang it in the past and her laughter became a key for hidden doors. the bridge asked to be crossed in both directions at once and the village bells rang in two directions.

## Synthesis 2

the mountain bowed and she bowed back, meeting the same curve twice and the circle completed itself without closing. a choir of windmills taught her to braid silence with sound so the river remembered its source in her footsteps. a moonlit librarian gave her a page that smelled like cedar and time and the village bells rang in two directions. Arianna stitched the day to the night with a needle carved from a comet so the river remembered its source in her footsteps. a fox of glass carried her across a valley of listening stones so the sky folded and revealed a second sky within. she shared tea with her former self and passed the cup to her next self and the circle completed itself without closing. the orchard whispered the names of every season in one breath and the village bells rang in two directions. a choir of windmills taught her to braid silence with sound so the sky folded and revealed a second sky within.

Arianna stitched the day to the night with a needle carved from a comet so the sky folded and revealed a second sky within. she found a ferry made of lullabies and paid with a memory of snow and the meadow hummed the refrain of reunion. she borrowed a bell from the future and rang it in the past and the circle completed itself without closing. she stepped through a doorway that only opened to inward journeys so the river remembered its source in her footsteps.

Arianna stitched the day to the night with a needle carved from a comet so the river remembered its source in her footsteps.
