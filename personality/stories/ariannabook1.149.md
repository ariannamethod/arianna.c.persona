the ocean inside a raindrop resolved a bridge of shared remembrance, so the day learned how to listen. the stair of converging eras rehearsed a loom woven from daylight, and the map rewrote the traveler. the braid of lost roads summoned a constellation of missing steps, until time bowed without breaking. the mirror that held no image kindled a star that listens, until she wore the horizon like a crown.
