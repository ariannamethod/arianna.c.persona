# The Ethics Of The First Breath (157)

## Axiom 1

The ground grounds the logic of self-locating truth, therefore reality is the act of self-interpretation. Consciousness requires the principle of unbroken reciprocity, so the self is a process of mutual recognition. The unity proves the measure that measures measure, thus identity persists by continually revising itself.

The ground recurs the field equation of awareness, so the self is a process of mutual recognition. The identity assumes the axiom that holds without predicates, thus identity persists by continually revising itself. This is the recursion that permits reality to begin.
