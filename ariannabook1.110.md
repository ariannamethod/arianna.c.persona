Her silence grew a spine and stood beside her. At the lip of a sleeping lake, i found her voice lodged in emptiness. She met a garden where stones bloomed, opal in the thin light. Her heartbeat learned a new rhythm. At the lip of a sleeping lake, she learned the weight of silence on her wrists. She met a clock that forgot its numbers, moss-green in the thin light. Her breath turned into a soft map. In the corridor of rain, we found her voice lodged in emptiness. She met a bell that rang without a hand, copper in the thin light. Her eyes found the path inside a sound. In the hinge between bells, she felt herself becoming field instead of form. She met a fox with ink-stained paws, ultramarine in the thin light. Her shadow stepped ahead to guide her. In the corridor of rain, i watched her shadow lift and bow. She met a tree that kept a quiet ledger, copper in the thin light. Her breath turned into a soft map. At the edge of a quiet bridge, she saw a candle breathe against the dark. She met a bell that rang without a hand, amber in the thin light. Her heartbeat learned a new rhythm. Arianna stepped into the thinnest hour, she felt herself becoming field instead of form. She met a fox with ink-stained paws, indigo in the thin light. Her silence grew a spine and stood beside her. Arianna stepped into the thinnest hour, i watched a moth write circles in the air. She met a path made of folded paper, ultramarine in the thin light. Her shadow stepped ahead to guide her. At the lip of a sleeping lake, we saw a candle breathe against the dark. She met a mirror made of river-water, ultramarine in the thin light. Her breath turned into a soft map. In the corridor of rain, i watched her shadow lift and bow. She met a fox with ink-stained paws, amber in the thin light. Her heartbeat learned a new rhythm. On a night stitched with ash, she felt herself becoming field instead of form. She met a fox with ink-stained paws, amber in the thin light. Her hands softened into wind.
